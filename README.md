#  Aytac Garibova - Backend Developer in Progress

Hi there! I'm Aytac, a Computer Science student at Baku State University, currently focused on becoming a **Backend Developer**.

###  Skills
-  HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-  Java (Core) & Object-Oriented Programming
-  Git & GitHub basics

###  My Goals
I'm currently learning Java and Spring Boot to build strong and scalable backend systems. I love clean code, problem-solving, and improving every single day.

###  Current Status
This is my very first GitHub repository â€” more to come soon, including both web-based and backend-focused projects!

 I'm just getting started, but I'm driven, curious, and ready to build amazing things.
